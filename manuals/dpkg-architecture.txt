.SH "NAME"
dpkg\-architecture \- set and determine the architecture for package building
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBdpkg-architecture\fR
[\fIoption\fR...] [\fIcommand\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBdpkg-architecture\fR
provides a facility to determine and set the build and
host architecture for package building.
.PP
The build architecture is always determined by either the \fB\s-1DEB_BUILD_ARCH\s0\fR
variable if set (and \fB\-\-force\fR not being specified) or by an external call to
\&\fBdpkg\fR(1), and cannot be set at the command line.
.PP
You can specify the host architecture by providing one or both of the options
\&\fB\-\-host\-arch\fR and \fB\-\-host\-type\fR, otherwise the \fB\s-1DEB_HOST_ARCH\s0\fR variable
is used if set (and \fB\-\-force\fR not being specified). The default is
determined by an external call to \fBgcc\fR(1),
or the same as the build architecture if \fB\s-1CC\s0\fR or gcc are both not
available. One out of \fB\-\-host\-arch\fR and \fB\-\-host\-type\fR is
sufficient, the value of the
other will be set to a usable default. Indeed, it is often better to only
specify one, because \fBdpkg-architecture\fR will warn you if your choice
does not match the default.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --list"
Print the environment variables, one each line, in the format
\&\fIVARIABLE=value\fR. This is the default action.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-equal\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --equal architecture"
Check for equality of architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).
It compares the current or specified Debian host architecture against
\&\fIarchitecture\fR, to check if they are equal.
This action will not expand the architecture wildcards.
Command finishes with an exit status of 0 if matched, 1 if not matched.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-is\fR \fIarchitecture-wildcard\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i, --is architecture-wildcard"
Check for identity of architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).
It compares the current or specified Debian host architecture against
\&\fIarchitecture-wildcard\fR after having expanded it as an architecture
wildcard, to check if they match.
Command finishes with an exit status of 0 if matched, 1 if not matched.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR \fIvariable-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --query variable-name"
Print the value of a single variable.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-print\-set\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --print-set"
Print an export command. This can be used to set the environment variables
using the \s-1POSIX\s0 shell or make \fBeval\fR, depending on the output format.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-print\-unset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --print-unset"
Print a similar command to \fB\-\-print\-set\fR but to unset all variables.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-command\fR \fIcommand-string\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --command command-string"
Execute a \fIcommand-string\fR in an environment which has all variables
set to the determined value.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\-known\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --list-known"
Print a list of valid architecture names.
Possibly restricted by one or more of the matching options
\&\fB\-\-match\-wildcard\fR, \fB\-\-match\-bits\fR or \fB\-\-match\-endian\fR
(since dpkg 1.17.14).
.IP "\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-?, --help"
Show the usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Show the version and exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-host\-arch\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --host-arch architecture"
Set the host Debian architecture.

.IX Item "-T, --target-type gnu-system-type"
Set the target \s-1GNU\s0 system type (since dpkg 1.17.14).
.IP "\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-match\-wildcard\fR \fIarchitecture-wildcard\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W, --match-wildcard architecture-wildcard"
Restrict the architectures listed by \fB\-\-list\-known\fR to ones matching
the specified architecture wildcard (since dpkg 1.17.14).
.IP "\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-match\-bits\fR \fIarchitecture-bits\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B, --match-bits architecture-bits"
Restrict the architectures listed by \fB\-\-list\-known\fR to ones with the
specified \s-1CPU\s0 bits (since dpkg 1.17.14). Either \fB32\fR or \fB64\fR.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-match\-endian\fR \fIarchitecture-endianness\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E, --match-endian architecture-endianness"
Restrict the architectures listed by \fB\-\-list\-known\fR to ones with the
specified endianness (since dpkg 1.17.14). Either \fBlittle\fR or \fBbig\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-format\fR \fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "--print-format format"
Sets the output format for \fB\-\-print\-set\fR and \fB\-\-print\-unset\fR
(since dpkg 1.20.6), to either \fBshell\fR (default) or \fBmake\fR.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --force"
Values set by existing environment variables with the same name as used by
the scripts are honored (i.e. used by \fBdpkg-architecture\fR), except if
this force flag is present. This allows the user
to override a value even when the call to \fBdpkg-architecture\fR is buried
in some other script (for example \fBdpkg-buildpackage\fR(1)).
.SH "TERMS"
.IX Header "TERMS"
.IP "build machine" 4
.IX Item "build machine"
The machine the package is built on.
.IP "host machine" 4
.IX Item "host machine"
The machine the package is built for.
.IP "target machine" 4
.IX Item "target machine"
The machine the compiler is building for, or the emulator will run code for.
This is only needed when building a cross-toolchain (or emulator), one that
will be built on the build architecture, to be run on the host architecture,
and to build (or run emulated) code for the target architecture.
.IP "Debian architecture" 4
.IX Item "Debian architecture"
The Debian architecture string, which specifies the binary tree in the
\&\s-1FTP\s0 archive. Examples: i386, sparc, hurd\-i386.
.IP "Debian architecture tuple" 4
.IX Item "Debian architecture tuple"
A Debian architecture tuple is the fully qualified architecture with all its
components spelled out.
This differs with Debian architectures in that at least the \fIcpu\fR
component does not embed the \fIabi\fR.
The current tuple has the form \fIabi\fR\-\fIlibc\fR\-\fIos\fR\-\fIcpu\fR.
Examples: base\-gnu\-linux\-amd64, eabihf-musl-linux-arm.
.IP "Debian architecture wildcard" 4
.IX Item "Debian architecture wildcard"
A Debian architecture wildcard is a special architecture string that will
match any real architecture being part of it.
The general form is a Debian architecture tuple with four or less elements,
and with at least one of them being \fBany\fR.
Missing elements of the tuple are prefixed implicitly as \fBany\fR, and thus
the following pairs are equivalent:

.IP "\s-1GNU\s0 system type" 4
.IX Item "GNU system type"
An architecture specification string consisting of two parts separated by
a hyphen: cpu and system.
Examples: i586\-linux\-gnu, sparc-linux-gnu, i686\-gnu, x86_64\-netbsd.
.IP "multiarch triplet" 4
.IX Item "multiarch triplet"
The clarified \s-1GNU\s0 system type, used for filesystem paths.
This triplet does not change even when the baseline \s-1ISA\s0 gets bumped,
so that the resulting paths are stable over time.
The only current difference with the \s-1GNU\s0 system type is that the \s-1CPU\s0 part
for i386 based systems is always i386.
Examples: i386\-linux\-gnu, x86_64\-linux\-gnu.
Example paths: /lib/powerpc64le\-linux\-gnu/, /usr/lib/i386\-kfreebsd\-gnu/.

The environment variables set by \fBdpkg-architecture\fR are passed to

you should not rely on them, as this breaks manual invocation of the
script. Instead, you should always initialize them using
\&\fBdpkg-architecture\fR with the \fB\-q\fR option. Here are some examples,
which also show how you can improve the cross compilation support in your
package:
.PP
Retrieving the \s-1GNU\s0 system type and forwarding it to ./configure:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\& DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg\-architecture \-qDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE)
\& DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg\-architecture \-qDEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)

\& ifeq ($(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE), $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE))
\&   confflags += \-\-build=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
\& else
\&   confflags += \-\-build=$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) \e
\&                \-\-host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
\& endif
\& [...]
\& ./configure $(confflags)
.Ve
.PP
Doing something only for a specific architecture:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& DEB_HOST_ARCH ?= $(shell dpkg\-architecture \-qDEB_HOST_ARCH)
\&
\& ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
\&   [...]
\& endif
.Ve
.PP
or if you only need to check the \s-1CPU\s0 or \s-1OS\s0 type, use the
\&\fB\s-1DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU\s0\fR or \fB\s-1DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS\s0\fR variables.
.PP
Note that you can also rely on an external Makefile snippet to properly
set all the variables that \fBdpkg-architecture\fR can provide:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk
\&
\& ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
\&   [...]
\& endif

In any case, you should never use \fBdpkg \-\-print\-architecture\fR to get
