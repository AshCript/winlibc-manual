\fBpip\fP is a Python package installer, recommended for installing Python
packages which are not available in the Debian archive.  It can work with
version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar
repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by
downloading all requirements before starting installation.

2, while \fBpip3\fP is the command to use when installing packages for
Python 3.
