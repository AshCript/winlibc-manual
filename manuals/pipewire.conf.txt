.SH NAME
pipewire.conf \- The PipeWire server configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire/pipewire.conf\fP
.sp
\fI/etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf\fP

\fI/usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
PipeWire is a service that facilitates sharing of multimedia content
between devices and applications.
.sp
On startup, the daemon reads a main configuration file to configure
itself. It executes a series of commands listed in the config
file.
.sp
The config files are loaded in the order listed in the \fI\%SYNOPSIS\fP\&.
The environment variables \fBPIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR\fP, \fBPIPEWIRE_CONFIG_PREFIX\fP
and \fBPIPEWIRE_CONFIG_NAME\fP can be used to specify an alternative config
directory, subdirectory and file respectively.
.sp
Next to the configuration file can be a directory with the same name as
the file with a \fB\&.d/\fP suffix. All directories in the \fI\%SYNOPSIS\fP directory
search paths are traversed in the listed order and the contents of the
\fB*.conf\fP files inside them are appended to the main configuration file
as overrides. Object sections are merged and array sections are appended.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
.sp
The configuration file format is grouped into sections. A section
is either a dictionary, {}, or an array, []. Dictionary and array
entries are separated by whitespace and may be simple value
assignment, an array or a dictionary. For example:
.sp
name = value # simple assignment
.sp
name = { key1 = value1 key2 = value2 } # a dictionary with two
entries
.sp
name = [ value1 value2 ] # an array with two entries
.sp
name = [ { k = v1 } { k = v2 } ] # an array of dictionaries
.sp
The configuration files can be expressed in full JSON syntax but for ease
of use, a relaxed format may be used where:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB:\fP to delimit keys and values can be substuted by \fB=\fP or a space.
.IP \(bu 2
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \fB\(dq\fP around keys and string can be omited as long as no special characters
are used in the strings.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fB,\fP to separate objects can be replaced with a whitespace character.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB#\fP can be used to start a comment until the line end

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SECTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B context.properties
Dictionary. These properties configure the PipeWire instance.
.TP
.B context.spa\-libs
Dictionary. Maps plugin features with globs to a spa library.
.TP
.B context.modules
Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is a dictionary with the \fIname\fP of the module to load,
including optional \fIargs\fP and \fIflags\fP\&. Most modules support being loaded
multiple times.
.TP
.B context.objects
Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is a dictionary containing the \fIfactory\fP to create an
object from and optional extra arguments specific to that factory.
.TP
.B context.exec
Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is dictionary containing the \fIpath\fP of a program to
execute on startup and optional \fIargs\fP\&.
.sp
This array used to contain an entry to start the session manager but this mode
of operation has since been demoted to development aid. Avoid starting a
session manager in this way in production environment.
