\fBWarning:   
.PP 
This file is a shell script, and 
as such is subject to a string variable assignment syntax. No space 
is allowed between the variable name, the equal (=) sign, and the 
value(s) assigned. If multiple values are to be assigned, the list 
must be space-delimited with surrounding quotes.

Two directives can be used in this file: 
\fBtypes\fP and \fBskip\fP. Both can be 
defined multiple times. 
.IP "\fBtypes\fP" 10 
This describes the classes of hardware that should be 
scanned and queried. 
.IP "\fBskip\fP" 10 
These modules should never be loaded. See the 
``\fIFiles\fP'' section for details on the mechanism for 
generating these entries automatically. 
.SH "Files" 
.IP "\fB/var/lib/discover/crash\fP" 10 
A crash file written and erased each time 
\fBdiscover-modprobe\fR attempts to load a 
module. If the file lingers, the computer is assumed to have 
crashed while loading that module, and the module name is added 
to \fBdiscover-modprobe.conf\fP as a module to 
skip in the future.
