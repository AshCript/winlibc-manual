.SH NAME
snap \- Tool to interact with snaps
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnap\fP [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The snap command lets you install, configure, refresh and remove snaps.
Snaps are packages that work across many different Linux distributions,
enabling secure delivery and operation of the latest apps and utilities.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Application Options
.SH COMMANDS
.SS abort
Abort a pending change

The \fIabort\fP command attempts to abort a change that still has pending tasks.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] abort [abort-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-last\fR\fP
Select last change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh, etc.). A question mark at the end of the type means to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if no change of the given type is found. Note the question mark could need protecting from the shell.
.SS ack
Add an assertion to the system

The \fIack\fP command tries to add an assertion to the system assertion database.

The assertion may also be a newer revision of a pre-existing assertion that it
will replace.

To succeed the assertion must be valid, its signature verified with a known
public key and the assertion consistent with and its prerequisite in the
database.
.SS alias
Set up a manual alias

The \fIalias\fP command aliases the given snap application to the given alias.

Once this manual alias is setup the respective application command can be
invoked just using the alias.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] alias [alias-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.SS aliases
List aliases in the system

The \fIaliases\fP command lists all aliases available in the system and their status.

$ snap aliases <snap>

Lists only the aliases defined by the specified snap.

An alias noted as undefined means it was explicitly enabled or disabled but is
not defined in the current revision of the snap, possibly temporarily (e.g.
because of a revert). This can cleared with 'snap alias --reset'.
.SS changes
List system changes

The \fIchanges\fP command displays a summary of system changes performed recently.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] changes [changes-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-abs-time\fR\fP
Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then YYYY-MM-DD.
.SS check-snapshot
Check a snapshot

The \fIcheck-snapshot\fP command verifies the user, system and configuration
data of the snaps included in the specified snapshot.

The check operation runs the same data integrity verification that is
performed when a snapshot is restored.

By default, this command checks all the data in a snapshot.
Alternatively, you can specify the data of which snaps to check, or
for which users, or a combination of these.

If a snap is included in a check-snapshot operation, excluding its
system and configuration data from the check is not currently
possible. This restriction may be lifted in the future.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] check-snapshot [check-snapshot-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-users\fR\fP
Check data of only specific users (comma-separated) (default: all users)
.SS connect
Connect a plug to a slot

The \fIconnect\fP command connects a plug to a slot.
It may be called in the following ways:

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

Connects the provided plug to the given slot.

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>

Connects the specific plug to the only slot in the provided snap that matches
the connected interface. If more than one potential slot exists, the command
fails.

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug>

Connects the provided plug to the slot in the core snap with a name matching
the plug name.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] connect [connect-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.SS connections
List interface connections

The \fIconnections\fP command lists connections between plugs and slots
in the system.

Unless <snap> is provided, the listing is for connected plugs and
slots for all snaps in the system. In this mode, pass --all to also
list unconnected plugs and slots.

$ snap connections <snap>

Lists connected and unconnected plugs and slots for the specified
snap.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] connections [connections-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-all\fR\fP
Show connected and unconnected plugs and slots
.SS create-cohort
Create cohort keys for a set of snaps

The \fIcreate-cohort\fP command creates a set of cohort keys for a given set of snaps.

A cohort is a view or snapshot of a snap's "channel map" at a given point in
time that fixes the set of revisions for the snap given other constraints
(e.g. channel or architecture). The cohort is then identified by an opaque
per-snap key that works across systems. Installations or refreshes of the snap
using a given cohort key would use a fixed revision for up to 90 days, after
which a new set of revisions would be fixed under that same cohort key and a
new 90 days window started.
.SS debug
Run debug commands


The debug command contains a selection of additional sub-commands.

Debug commands can be removed without notice and may not work on
non-development systems.

$ snap disconnect <snap>:<slot or plug>

Disconnects everything from the provided plug or slot.
The snap name may be omitted for the core snap.

When an automatic connection is manually disconnected, its disconnected state
is retained after a snap refresh. The --forget flag can be added to the
disconnect command to reset this behaviour, and consequently re-enable
an automatic reconnection after a snap refresh.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] disconnect [disconnect-OPTIONS]

.SS find
Find packages to install

The \fIfind\fP command queries the store for available packages.

With the --private flag, which requires the user to be logged-in to the store
(see 'snap help login'), it instead searches for private snaps that the user
has developer access to, either directly or through the store's collaboration
feature.

A green check mark (given color and unicode support) after a publisher name
indicates that the publisher has been verified.

.TP
\fB\fB\-\-abs-time\fR\fP
.SS info
Show detailed information about snaps

The \fIinfo\fP command shows detailed information about snaps.

The snaps can be specified by name or by path; names are looked for both in the
store and in the installed snaps; paths can refer to a .snap file, or to a
directory that contains an unpacked snap suitable for 'snap try' (an example
of this would be the 'prime' directory snapcraft produces).

.SS install
Install snaps on the system

The \fIinstall\fP command installs the named snaps on the system.

To install multiple instances of the same snap, append an underscore and a
unique identifier (for each instance) to a snap's name.

With no further options, the snaps are installed tracking the stable channel,
with strict security confinement. All available channels of a snap are listed in
its 'snap info' output.

Revision choice via the --revision override requires the user to
have developer access to the snap, either directly or through the
store's collaboration feature, and to be logged in (see 'snap help login').

Note that a later refresh will typically undo a revision override, taking the snap
back to the current revision of the channel it's tracking.

Use --name to set the instance name when installing from snap file.

.SS login
Authenticate to snapd and the store

The \fIlogin\fP command authenticates the user to snapd and the snap store, and saves
credentials into the ~/.snap/auth.json file. Further communication with snapd
will then be made using those credentials.

It's not necessary to log in to interact with snapd. Doing so, however, enables
interactions without sudo, as well as some some developer-oriented features as
detailed in the help for the find, install and refresh commands.

An account can be set up at https://login.ubuntu.com

assertion's non-meta headers.

The verbose output is presented in a structured, yaml-like format.

Similarly, the active serial assertion can be used for the output instead of the
model assertion.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] model [model-OPTIONS]

.SS okay
Acknowledge warnings

The \fIokay\fP command acknowledges the warnings listed with 'snap warnings'.

Once acknowledged a warning won't appear again unless it re-occurrs and
sufficient time has passed.
.SS pack
Pack the given directory as a snap

The \fIpack\fP command packs the given snap-dir as a snap and writes the result to
target-dir. If target-dir is omitted, the result is written to current
directory. If both source-dir and target-dir are omitted, the pack command packs
the current directory.

The default file name for a snap can be derived entirely from its snap.yaml, but
in some situations it's simpler for a script to feed the filename in. In those
cases, --filename can be given to override the default. If this filename is
not absolute it will be taken as relative to target-dir.

When used with --check-skeleton, pack only checks whether snap-dir contains
valid snap metadata and raises an error otherwise. Application commands listed
in snap metadata file, but appearing with incorrect permission bits result in an
error. Commands that are missing from snap-dir are listed in diagnostic
messages.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] pack [pack-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-check-skeleton\fR\fP
Validate snap-dir metadata only

none are specified.

With no further options, the snaps are refreshed to the current revision of the
channel they're tracking, preserving their confinement options. All available
channels of a snap are listed in its 'snap info' output.

Revision choice via the --revision override requires the user to
have developer access to the snap, either directly or through the
store's collaboration feature, and to be logged in (see 'snap help login').

Note a later refresh will typically undo a revision override.

.SS remove
Remove snaps from the system

The \fIremove\fP command removes the named snap instance from the system.

By default all the snap revisions are removed, including their data and the
common data directory. When a --revision option is passed only the specified
revision is removed.

Unless automatic snapshots are disabled, a snapshot of all data for the snap is 
saved upon removal, which is then available for future restoration with snap
restore. The --purge option disables automatically creating snapshots.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] remove [remove-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-revision\fR\fP

If the --reload option is given, for each service whose app has a reload
command, a reload is performed instead of a restart.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] restart [restart-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-reload\fR\fP

.SS restore
Restore a snapshot

The \fIrestore\fP command replaces the current user, system and
configuration data of included snaps, with the corresponding data from
the specified snapshot.

By default, this command restores all the data in a snapshot.
Alternatively, you can specify the data of which snaps to restore, or
for which users, or a combination of these.

If a snap is included in a restore operation, excluding its system and
configuration data from the restore is not currently possible. This
restriction may be lifted in the future.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] restore [restore-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-users\fR\fP
Restore data of only specific users (comma-separated) (default: all users)
.SS revert
Reverts the given snap to the previous state

The \fIrevert\fP command reverts the given snap to its state before
the latest refresh. This will reactivate the previous snap revision,
and will use the original data that was associated with that revision,
discarding any data changes that were done by the latest revision. As
an exception, data which the snap explicitly chooses to share across
revisions is not touched by the revert process.

\fBUsage\fP: snap [OPTIONS] revert [revert-OPTIONS]
.TP
\fB\fB\-\-no-wait\fR\fP
Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

The \fIsave\fP command creates a snapshot of the current user, system and
configuration data for the given snaps.

By default, this command saves the data of all snaps for all users.
Alternatively, you can specify the data of which snaps to save, or
for which users, or a combination of these.

If a snap is included in a save operation, excluding its system and
configuration data from the snapshot is not currently possible. This
restriction may be lifted in the future.

    $ snap set snap-name username=frank password=$PASSWORD

All configuration changes are persisted at once, and only after the
snap's configuration hook returns successfully.

Nested values may be modified via a dotted path:

    $ snap set snap-name author.name=frank

Configuration option may be unset with exclamation mark:
    $ snap set snap-name author!

.SS try
Test an unpacked snap in the system

The \fItry\fP command installs an unpacked snap into the system for testing purposes.
The unpacked snap content continues to be used even after installation, so
non-metadata changes there go live instantly. Metadata changes such as those
performed in snap.yaml will require reinstallation to go live.

If snap-dir argument is omitted, the try command will attempt to infer it if
either snapcraft.yaml file and prime directory or meta/snap.yaml file can be
found relative to current working directory.

Once warnings have been listed with 'snap warnings', 'snap okay' may be used to
silence them. A warning that's been silenced in this way will not be listed
again unless it happens again, _and_ a cooldown time has passed.

Warnings expire automatically, and once expired they are forgotten.
