.TH "SNAP-CONFINE" 8 "2017-09-18" "2.28" "snappy"
.SH NAME
snap-confine \- internal tool for confining snappy applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
snap\-confine [\-\-classic] [\-\-base BASE] SECURITY_TAG COMMAND [...ARGUMENTS]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fIsnap\-confine\fP is a program used internally by \fIsnapd\fP to construct the
execution environment for snap applications.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fIsnap\-confine\fP program accepts two options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fI\-\-classic\fP requests the so\-called _classic_ _confinement_ in which
applications are not confined at all (like in classic systems, hence the
name). This disables the use of a dedicated, per\-snap mount namespace. The
\fIsnapd\fP service generates permissive apparmor and seccomp profiles that
allow everything.
.sp
\fI\-\-base BASE\fP directs snap\-confine to use the given base snap as the root
filesystem. If omitted it defaults to the \fIcore\fP snap. This is derived from
snap meta\-data by \fIsnapd\fP when starting the application process.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH FEATURES
.SS Apparmor profiles
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP switches to the apparmor profile \fI$SECURITY_TAG\fP\&. The profile is
\fBmandatory\fP and \fIsnap\-confine\fP will refuse to run without it.
.sp
The profile has to be loaded into the kernel prior to using \fIsnap\-confine\fP\&.
Typically this is arranged for by \fIsnapd\fP\&. The profile contains rich
description of what the application process is allowed to do, this includes
system calls, file paths, access patterns, linux capabilities, etc. The
apparmor profile can also do extensive dbus mediation. Refer to apparmor
documentation for more details.
.SS Seccomp profiles
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP looks for the
\fI/var/lib/snapd/seccomp/bpf/$SECURITY_TAG.bin\fP file. This file is
\fBmandatory\fP and \fIsnap\-confine\fP will refuse to run without it. This
file contains the seccomp bpf binary program that is loaded into the
kernel by snap\-confine.
.sp
The file is generated with the \fI/usr/lib/snapd/snap\-seccomp\fP compiler from the
\fI$SECURITY_TAG.src\fP file that uses a custom syntax that describes the set of
allowed system calls and optionally their arguments. The profile is then used
to confine the started application.
.sp
As a security precaution disallowed system calls cause the started application
executable to be killed by the kernel. In the future this restriction may be
lifted to return \fIEPERM\fP instead.
.SS Mount profiles
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP uses a helper process, \fIsnap\-update\-ns\fP, to apply the mount
namespace profile to freshly constructed mount namespace. That tool looks for
the \fI/var/lib/snapd/mount/snap.$SNAP_NAME.fstab\fP file.  If present it is read,
parsed and treated like a mostly\-typical \fIfstab(5)\fP file.  The mount directives
listed there are executed in order. All directives must succeed as any failure
will abort execution.
.sp
By default all mount entries start with the following flags: \fIbind\fP, \fIro\fP,
\fInodev\fP, \fInosuid\fP\&.  Some of those flags can be reversed by an appropriate
option (e.g. \fIrw\fP can cause the mount point to be writable).
.sp
Certain additional features are enabled and conveyed through the use of mount
options prefixed with \fIx\-snapd\-\fP\&.
.sp
As a security precaution only \fIbind\fP mounts are supported at this time.
.SS Sharing of the mount namespace
.sp
As of version 1.0.41 all the applications from the same snap will share the
same mount namespace. Applications from different snaps continue to use
separate mount namespaces.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP responds to the following environment variables
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fISNAP_CONFINE_DEBUG\fP:
When defined the program will print additional diagnostic information about
the actions being performed. All the output goes to stderr.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following variables are only used when \fIsnap\-confine\fP is not setuid root.
This is only applicable when testing the program itself.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fISNAPPY_LAUNCHER_INSIDE_TESTS\fP:
Internal variable that should not be relied upon.
.TP
.B \fISNAPPY_LAUNCHER_SECCOMP_PROFILE_DIR\fP:
Internal variable that should not be relied upon.
.TP
.B \fISNAP_USER_DATA\fP:
Full path to the directory like /home/$LOGNAME/snap/$SNAP_NAME/$SNAP_REVISION.
.sp
This directory is created by snap\-confine on startup. This is a temporary
feature that will be merged into snapd\(aqs snap\-run command. The set of directories
that can be created is confined with apparmor.
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP and \fIsnap\-update\-ns\fP use the following files:
.sp
\fI/var/lib/snapd/mount/snap.*.fstab\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Description of the mount profile.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/var/lib/snapd/seccomp/bpf/*.src\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Input for the /usr/lib/snapd/snap\-seccomp profile compiler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/var/lib/snapd/seccomp/bpf/*.bin\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Compiled seccomp bpf profile programs.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/run/snapd/ns/\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Directory used to keep shared mount namespaces.
.sp
\fIsnap\-confine\fP internally converts this directory to a private bind mount.
Semantically the behavior is identical to the following mount commands:
.sp
mount \-\-bind /run/snapd/ns /run/snapd/ns
mount \-\-make\-private /run/snapd/ns
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/run/snapd/ns/.lock\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A \fIflock(2)\fP\-based lock file acquired to create and convert
\fI/run/snapd/ns/\fP to a private bind mount.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/run/snapd/ns/$SNAP_NAME.lock\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A \fIflock(2)\fP\-based lock file acquired to create or join the mount namespace
represented as \fI/run/snaps/ns/$SNAP_NAME.mnt\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/run/snapd/ns/$SNAP_NAME.mnt\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This file can be either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An empty file that may be seen before the mount namespace is preserved or
when the mount namespace is unmounted.
.IP \(bu 2
A file belonging to the \fInsfs\fP file system, representing a fully
populated mount namespace of a given snap. The file is bind mounted from
\fI/proc/self/ns/mnt\fP from the first process in any snap.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fI/proc/self/mountinfo\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This file is read to decide if \fI/run/snapd/ns/\fP needs to be created and
converted to a private bind mount, as described above.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the apparmor profile is external to \fIsnap\-confine\fP and is loaded
directly into the kernel. The actual apparmor profile is managed by \fIsnapd\fP\&.
